export const PRIVACY_COMMITMENT = `Our Privacy Commitment

This application is built on a Local-First Architecture. This means:

Your Data Never Leaves This Device: All business invoices, family budgets, and call logs are stored in a private, encrypted database inside your browser's local storage.

AI Stays Offline: The Gemma 3 AI models run on your device's hardware (GPU/NPU). We do not have servers that "see" your prompts or your camera feed.

No Tracking: We do not use third-party analytics or cookies. You are the only person with the "key" to your digital life.

Total Control: If you delete the app or clear its local storage, your data is gone forever from our end—because we never had it to begin with.`;
